# Cactool Worksheets

Here are key worksheets you can complete to familiarise yourself with undertaking a content analysis with Cactool. They come with datasets so no need to collect your own data beforehand. We recommend going through both before undertaking an analysis on your own.

These are designed to be easy to follow, and are a great way of teaching yourself, or your students, how to use the platform.
