## This install process seems a little complicated, why?

The installation pathway, admittedly, is a little complex (which is why we’ve produced detailed guides). However, this is a necessity to give users a large degree of configurability and allows you to share your instance with others.

## What licence does Cactool run under? 

[Cactool runs under the MIT License](https://github.com/cactool/cactool/blob/main/LICENSE). This is a short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code. 

In short, this means it’s free, and you can use it how you like with few limitations. But is provided “As is”, so you can’t sue or take legal action against us for any reason.



# Troubleshooting

## I’ve spotted a bug or an issue 
If you find any problems with Cactool, please report the issue via the issue tracker here: https://github.com/cactool/cactool/issues or email the PI at Liam.McLoughlin [] Liverpool.ac.uk

If possible, please let us know what circumstances led to the bug.

*Please note, we can’t provide individual support with your project or set up.


## I get a “The Connection was Reset” message when attempting to upload a file.
This might mean the file you’re uploading is larger than the upload file size limit. Increase the file size limit and try again. 


## I get a 404 Error when uploading a file.
Make sure you have avoided any unnecessary special characters in the dataset headers (such as * & ^ % ?). We’re looking into fixing this.


## I’ve updated to a new version of Cactool, but nothing has changed?
If you’re using Docker, you will need to delete the Cactool Container & Image within Docker (*WARNING this will delete any research data!*)

## Do you offer Paid Support?
If, for whatever reason, you feel the need to bring in external assistance in setting up and hosting Cactool, Sam Ezeh can offer reasonable pricing structures for set-up assistance. Please contact them for this.

## Is Cactool available in any other languages?
Sadly not. Although if you’d like to work with us for translating Cactool, please get in touch!
